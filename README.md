# solid-recipes
A recipe website created with HTML and CSS.

The website has a main page and links to several recipes. 
This website is a part of my learning with the Odin Project. 

This project demonstrates my HTML skills, the ability to create a functional website with structured and organized code, as well as my Git and GitHub skills.
