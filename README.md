# solid-recipes
A recipe website created with HTML and CSS.

The website has a home page and links to 3 breakfast recipes. 
This website is a part of my learning with the Odin Project. 

This project demonstrates my following HTML skills: 
- The ability to create multiple web-pages
- Navigation between pages in different folders using relative links
- Effective organization of my files
- Implementation of ordered and unordered lists, images, and various font sizes

As well as my Git and GitHub skills.
